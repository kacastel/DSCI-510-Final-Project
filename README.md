# Title: Voter Profile Demographics based on Covid-19 Vaccination Rates in San Diego County
# i. I plan to determine the relationship (correlation) between Covid-19 Vaccine Rates with the voter turnout in the 2020 election in San Diego County. Furthermore, I plan to describe the voter socio-economic profile as detailed by the California Healthy Places Index (HPI), by census tracts. The findings will be submitted via a report with support from a data-dynamic storyboard on the Microsoft PowerBI platform, which will allow users to access via web-browser

  Contains two visuals via scatterplot function. Details are:
  Visual #1: Shows HPI Value by Census Tract Population - Visual reveals a clustering of higher HPI Values for Census Tract Populations that are under 10,000 people. 
  Visual #2: Shows HPI Value by Percentile Score (Voter turnout) - Visual reveals the (expected) proportional relationship between the derived HPI Value (score) and the    Percentile of Voter Turnout score.
